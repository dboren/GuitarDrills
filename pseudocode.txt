User will set state variables via front-end inputs (either dropdowns or radio buttons)

State determines what sort of tab they get


Generating the tab
    This is the hard part. I can't just generate text linearly because every point in time on the tab is multiple lines. Is there a way to generate a measure at a time?
        Will start with generating something blank and then perhaps fret numbers can be swapped into "-" locations on some sort of coordinate basis.
            Arrays within arrays?
